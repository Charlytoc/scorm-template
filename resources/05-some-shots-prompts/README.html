		<h1>What are &quot;Shots&quot; in Prompt Creation? ðŸŽ¬</h1>
<p>In the context of AI and machine learning, &quot;shots&quot; refer to the number of examples provided to the model to help it understand the task. Let's break down the different types:</p>
<h4>Zero-Shot Prompting</h4>
<p>Zero-shot prompting means giving the AI a task without any example. The AI has to rely solely on its pre-existing knowledge and instructions to generate a response.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Generate a JSON object that represents a user
</code></pre>
<h4>One-Shot Prompting</h4>
<p>One-shot prompting involves providing the AI with one example to help it better understand the task.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Generate a JSON object that represents a user
Example: &quot;&quot;&quot;
{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: 30,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john.doe@example.com&quot;
}
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Remember to use delimiters ðŸ‘€.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Few-Shot Prompting</h4>
<p>Few-shot prompting means giving the AI a few examples to improve its understanding of the task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Generally, for large language models, it is not necessary to give many examples to understand a pattern; usually, 2 or 3 examples are sufficient depending on the complexity of the task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Generate a movie dialogue for a romantic comedy. There are two characters, Alice and Robert, who are childhood friends and fall in love.

Examples:
&lt;Alice&gt;: I've always had a crush on you, Robert.
&lt;Robert&gt;: I never knew, Alice. I feel the same way.

The scene ends with them holding hands and looking into each other's eyes.
</code></pre>
<h4>Many-Shot Prompting</h4>
<p>Many-shot prompting involves providing the AI with many examples. This is often used when the task is complex and requires more context and examples to be understood.</p>
<h3>Why Examples Help ðŸ§©</h3>
<p>Providing examples in prompts can significantly improve the performance of the AI. Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> Examples give the AI a better understanding of the task by providing context.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The AI can recognize patterns in the examples and apply them to generate more accurate responses.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction of Ambiguity:</strong> Examples help reduce ambiguity, making it easier for the AI to understand what is expected.</li>
</ol>
<h2>TIPS ðŸ¤–</h2>
<ol>
<li>Experiment with different types of prompts (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and many-shot) using the provided examples.</li>
<li>Observe how the AI's responses change with the number of examples given.</li>
<li>Try creating your own prompts for different tasks and see how providing examples affects the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's put into practice what you've learned about &quot;shots&quot; in prompt creation! ðŸš€</p>
